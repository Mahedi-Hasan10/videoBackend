===========Aggregation Pipeline Basic Documentation===============

1. How many users are active? ( $match , $count )

[
  {
    $match: {
      isActive:true
    }
  },{
    $count: 'authors'
  }
]

The given MongoDB aggregation pipeline counts the number of active users in a collection. The $match stage filters documents where isActive is true, and the $count stage counts the resulting documents, returning the count with the key 'authors'.


2. What is the average age of all users? ( $group , $avg )
[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$gender",
      averageAge:{
        $avg:"$age"
      }
      
    }
  }
]
The MongoDB aggregation pipeline calculates the average age of users grouped by gender. The $group stage groups the documents by the gender field (_id: "$gender"), and the $avg operator calculates the average age (averageAge: { $avg: "$age" }) for each gender group.


3.List the top 5 common favorite fruits amoung the users ? ( $group , $sum, $sort, $limit )
[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$favoriteFruit",
      count: {
        $sum: 1
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $sort: {
      count: -1
    }
  },
  {
    $limit: 5
  }
]

The MongoDB aggregation pipeline lists the top 5 most common favorite fruits among users. The $group stage groups the documents by the favoriteFruit field and counts the occurrences of each fruit using $sum: 1. The $sort stage orders the fruits by count in descending order (-1), and the $limit stage restricts the result to the top 5 fruits.



4.Find the total number of males and females ? ( $group, $sum )

[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$gender",
      count:{
        $sum:1,
      }
     
    }
  }
]
This MongoDB aggregation pipeline counts the number of users grouped by their gender. The $group stage groups documents by the gender field (_id: "$gender"), and the $sum: 1 operation counts the number of documents (users) within each gender group, storing the result in the count field.

5. Which country has the highest number of registered users ? 

[
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$company.location.country",
      countUser:{
        $sum: 1
      }
    },
  },
  {
    $sort: {
      countUser: -1
    }
  },
  {
    $limit: 1
  }
]

This MongoDB aggregation pipeline identifies the country with the highest number of users. The $group stage groups documents by the country field nested within company.location (_id: "$company.location.country"), and counts the number of users in each country using $sum: 1, storing the result in the countUser field. The $sort stage orders the countries by the countUser in descending order (-1), and the $limit stage restricts the result to the top country with the most users.
